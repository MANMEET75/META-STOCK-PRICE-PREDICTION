<h3>Meta Stock Price Predictor</h3>
<p>Application = We can use this deep learning model to predict the trends in the stock market which might be very profitable but as we all know that we cannot predict the accurate stock prices because if we can do so then we would all become billionaires. we can see the upward and downward trends over here using this model   </p>
<p>Note:- For this Model, I have collected 10 years of the dataset from yahoofinance.com then After using all the data preprocessing techniques. I have built and trained Recurrent Neural Network using Keras I have added LSTM layers (Long Short Term Memory).  I collected the dataset till JUN 22 then I  predicted the trend for the Whole month of JULY 22 and as you can see in the repository I got an almost similar pattern.</p>
